### 1. Using the 173 majors listed in fivethirtyeight.comâ€™s College Majors dataset [https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-economic-guide-to-picking-a-college-major/], provide code that identifies the majors that contain either "DATA" or "STATISTICS"


```{r filter-grepl-demo, message=F}
(read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/college-majors/majors-list.csv") %>%
    filter(str_detect(Major, "DATA|STATISTICS")))
```

### 2. Write code that transforms the data below:
[1] "bell pepper"  "bilberry"     "blackberry"   "blood orange"

[5] "blueberry"    "cantaloupe"   "chili pepper" "cloudberry"  

[9] "elderberry"   "lime"         "lychee"       "mulberry"    

[13] "olive"        "salal berry"

Into a format like this:

c("bell pepper", "bilberry", "blackberry", "blood orange", "blueberry", "cantaloupe", "chili pepper", "cloudberry", "elderberry", "lime", "lychee", "mulberry", "olive", "salal berry")


```{r collapse-demo}
(c("bell pepper", "bilberry", "blackberry", "blood orange", "blueberry", "cantaloupe", "chili pepper", "cloudberry", "elderberry","lime", "lychee", "mulberry", "olive", "salal berry") %>%
    str_c(collapse=", "))
```

### 3. Describe, in words, what these expressions will match:


* (.)\1\1
1. One group (w/a character inside), repeated, and then repeated again:
```{r}
str_view("aaa", "(.)\\1\\1")
```

* "(.)(.)\\2\\1"
2. Two groups (each w/one character inside), repeated but in reverse order:
```{r}
str_view("goog", "(.)(.)\\2\\1")
```

* (..)\1
3. One group (w/two characters inside), repeated:
```{r}
str_view("xyxy", "(..)\\1")
```

* "(.).\\1.\\1"
4. One group (one character inside), then another character, repeated, then just Group 1 again.
```{r}
str_view("gogog", "(.).\\1.\\1")

```

* "(.)(.)(.).*\\3\\2\\1"
5. Three groups (one character in each), repeated but in reverse order:
```{r}
str_view("123321", "(.)(.)(.).*\\3\\2\\1")

```

### 4 Construct regular expressions to match words that:

Start and end with the same character.
Contain a repeated pair of letters (e.g. "church" contains "ch" repeated twice.)
Contain one letter repeated in at least three places (e.g. "eleven" contains three "e"s.)

```{r}
str_view("123321", regex("
                            ^(.)            # begins with a group (w/a char inside)
                            (.*\\1$|\\1?$)  # 0 or more characters, then ends w/group 1
                                            # OR Ends with 0 or 1 occurence of group 1
                         ", comments = T))

```
